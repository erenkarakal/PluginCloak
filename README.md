# PluginCloak
A java rewrite of [PluginGuard](https://github.com/erenkarakal/PluginGuard). Tested on 1.19.4.  

# Requirements  
- [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
- [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)

# Features
## Command Hider
PluginCloak hides all the commands from the player except the ones in the config.
This won't hide proxy commands. Support for proxy is not planned.
If a player executes a command that doesn't exist or they can't see, it will return "Unknown Command".

## Cheat Detection
PluginCloak can detect cheaters who are trying to see your plugins. You can return a fake list, crash them, show no plugins or run a console command on them.
This check is 100% accurate.
